## LiteUploader

This is a lightweight library for NodeJS and jQuery, aiming to make uploading files a doddle. With some useful options including basic validation, it is a good choice for any developer who is not so worried about supporting legacy browsers.

### Features

- file type and size validation
- support for custom validators
- hooks for all major events like progress, success, fail etc
- drag/drop support
- ability dynamically update the form data packet before each upload
- upload multiple files as individual requests

### NodeJS

`npm install lite-uploader --save`

### Bower

`bower install lite-uploader --save`

### Examples

See [examples.md](https://github.com/burt202/lite-uploader/blob/master/examples.md)
