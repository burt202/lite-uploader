## LiteUploader - HTML5 jQuery File Uploader <sup>v3.0.0</sup>

This is a small jQuery plugin which utilises the HTML5 features ([File API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/) and [XHR2](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/)) to make uploading files a doddle.

With some useful options including basic validation, it is a good choice for any developer who is not so worried about supporting legacy browsers.

### Bower

`bower install lite-uploader --save`

### Error Types

Below is an overview of the error types that can be returned when validating files

* type - when file mime type does not match any mime types supplied in the rule.allowedFileTypes option
* size - when file size is above the size (in bytes) supplied in the rule.maxSize option
* refRequired - when there is no name attribute on the file input
* scriptOptionRequired - when no 'script' option is passed to the plugin
* noFilesSelected - when no files have been selected for the file input

### Public API

#### startUpload()

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>

### Gotchas

* make sure your uploads directory is writable: `chmod 777`

### Browser Support

The two main HTML5 dependencies for the plugin are the File API and XHR2, and using caniuse ([File API](http://caniuse.com/fileapi), [XHR2](http://caniuse.com/xhr2)) as a reference, if you are using any of the following browser versions you shouldn't have any problem with the code:

* Chrome 13+
* Firefox 4+
* Internet Explorer 10+
* Safari 6+
* Opera 12+

Using [this tool I built](http://browser.burtdev.net) which is based on stats from [gs.statcounter.com](http://gs.statcounter.com), as of October 2015, the browser versions listed above should account for approx 86% of all internet users

### Examples

See [examples.md](https://github.com/burt202/lite-uploader/blob/master/examples.md)
